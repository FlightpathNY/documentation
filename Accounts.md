Normally, we want to have separate admin accounts for Flightpath and the client users. In the case the client changes the password, we will still have access to the admin system. Never use the same passwords for different clients.All passwords should be autogenerated, at least 15 characters, and not easy to remember. Use <http://strongpasswordgenerator.com>. The exception is passwords for staging sites, which we may want to give over the phone or easily type in on mobile devices and whose main purpose is to block web crawlers.
Make sure account information is added to the appropriate [Documentation](Documentation.md).
